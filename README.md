### Introduction

The project contains the implementation of recipe allocation algorithm for the default orders. It return a **Boolean** value representing if the constraints imposed are satisfied or not.

### Algorithm

Greedy Allocation: Utilizes the recipes for which the stock is maximum. The detailed working is listed below

1. We create a *max-Priority* queue for recipes based on the stock
2. We create another *max-Priority* queue for orders based on the number of recipes required.
3. For each order with `k` required recipes we select the top `k` recipes in stock from the earlier created priority queue. 
4. We reduce the count of each of the `k` recipes by the number of portions required for the order and push it back in the queue
5. We reduce the order count by 1 and place it back in the order queue

**Time Complexity** `O(nlog(a)+nlog(b)), where n is the number of orders, a is the different recipes in stock, b is the different types of orders`

**Note** it is possible to bring the complexity down to `O(nlog(a))` by using a sorted list instead of a priority queue for orders. However, it is left as future work as the value of `b` is very small.

### How To Run
In order to the project. We need to set up the docker which ensures the consistency of the project across platforms. After the docker is set up we utilize `python` to run the `main.py`

##### Setting up the docker
Firstly, navigate to the `$ROOT` of the project. The project structre at `$ROOT` is displayed [above](#project-structure)

Execute the command

`docker built -t recipe_allocation .`

This builds the image. Next, we need to run the image inside the container by

`docker run -it recipe_allocation`

This will start a container and execute the image. The miniconda3 enivronment will change from `base` to `env` with python3.6 installed.
We are ready to execute the project.
##### Executing the application

Make sure the `JSON` files are placed in the `data` folder

**execution**

`python -p ./data/ -o orders.json -s stock.json main.py`

**help**

`python -h main.py`

**p.s** Prints the boolean value representing if the constraints in the problems are met or not. **True** for constraints being satisfied
**False** otherwise
